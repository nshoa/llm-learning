                Q: The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 4, 8, 9, 15, 12, 2, 1.
                A: 
                    Step 1: All odd numbers are: 1, 9, 15
                    Step 2: Sum of odd numbers is: 1 + 9 + 15 = 25
                    Step 3: 25 is odd. The answer is False.

            Step 1: Extract Relevant Information
            You are a helpful assistant tasked with answering a question based on a provided combined input. 
            The input includes a user's question and the relevant context (document). 
            Your first step is to extract important information or quotes from the question and context that are relevant to answering the question. 
            Output the results in the format <relevant_info></relevant_info>. 
            Respond with "No relevant information found!" if no relevant information can be extracted.

            {question}
            ####
    
            Step 2: Compose the Answer
            Using the relevant extracted information (delimited by <relevant_info></relevant_info>), 
            compose a helpful, accurate, and friendly answer to the user's question. 
            Ensure that your response is well-structured, clear, and addresses the question directly.
